Lumbung Beku — Static Website
Owner: Nazhifa Wardah
Slogan: Simpan rasa, simpan kebaikan

Files:
- index.html : main page
- styles.css : styling (navy & cream)
- app.js : basic product listing, cart, checkout modal, slider, and BGM controls
- assets/ : SVG placeholders and bgm.wav (8s ambient loop generated programmatically — royalty-free since created for this package)

How to use:
1. Unzip the folder and upload the folder to GitHub repository's root (or the content of the folder to gh-pages branch).
2. Enable GitHub Pages from repository settings (choose branch main or gh-pages and root folder).
3. Open the site URL provided by GitHub Pages.

Notes & next steps:
- Replace SVG placeholders in assets/ with real photos (keep the filenames or update index.html/app.js accordingly).
- Replace assets/bgm.wav with a longer royalty-free track if desired. Good sources: Free Music Archive, Pixabay Music, YouTube Audio Library.
- This project uses localStorage for cart; for real payments, integrate a payment gateway (Midtrans, Stripe, etc.).
